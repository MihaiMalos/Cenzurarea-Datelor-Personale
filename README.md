# Personal Data Censoring

The project censors the personal data of a completed .txt document, based on the document model. Basically, it's replacing all the filled data with '#' characters. I've been using the Knuth-Morirs-Pratt Algorithm as the string-matching algorithm, modifying it to find only the first occurrence, from a starting point, getting a linear efficiency for the overall project. 

This project was implemented by: Malos Mihai, Ivan Cosmin, and Toma Livia.
